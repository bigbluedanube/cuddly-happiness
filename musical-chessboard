Get a chessboard, preferably wood or glass--frosted = black, clear = white
Add LED beneath each square on the board (breadboard beneath, so maybe wood)
Violin harmonics - 3rd position, so 1 sul G = C4
Add a photoresistor to trigger LED lights and sounds
Use OSC (or something else) to connect board to PD, SC or Max patch.
Add a fiddle-like object to analyze frequencies, helps execute commands
Use gameplay code to make LEDs respond to frequencies "heard" by PC/SC/Max.

// dosctring, specs, Standard American English //
varA = 1 sul G // high D //
varB = 4 sul G // 8va //
varC = 1 sul D // high A //
varD = 4 sul D // 8va //
varE = 1 sul A // high E //
varF = 4 sul A // 8va //
varG = 1 sul E // 
varH = 4 sul E

if varA:
    moveForward 1 space
if varB:
    moveBack 1 space
if varC:
    moveLeft 1 space
if varD:
    moveRight 1 space

BUGS/LOGISTICAL ISSUES
1. Can't use only natural harmonics. 
    Creates duplicates. 
    Error message or no, frequencies will trigger execution of multiple commands and might crash the program. 
    If it doesn't crash, use these duplicates for complex pieces like the knight, 
    which moves across horizontal and vertical axes.

2. Individual methods for each piece.
    See methods below.

3. METHODS for capturing pieces
    creates more problems with duplicate frequencies.
    too many possible combinations
    If [specific checkmate pattern]:
        [trigger specific set of frequencies]
    elif [other checkmate pattern]:
        [trigger a musical motif]
    more elifs for a large but finite number of checkmate patterns:
        [trigger large but finite no. of leitmotifs]

4. METHODS for player errors:
    a. when a player is in check and makes an impossible move
        [musical equivalent of an error message--BEEP! BEEP!]
    b. when a player attempts to move a piece after putting it down
        [another musical error message]
    c. when a player loses a game - maybe some sound effects, too?
        could be a rude sound--HAHA, LOSER!
        could also be something sad, WOMP, WOMP!

5. Methods for player successes:
    a. when a player captures their opponent's pieces
        [maybe a bell sound, player associates bell with success]
    b. when a player puts their opponent in check
        [something tense to signal danger for player in check
        and possible victory for opponent]

METHODS CREATED THIS FAR:
  def Pawn
    // method for normal gameplay //
    // have a method for Start_of_Game //
    // another method for en passant captures //
  
  def Rook
    // method for normal gameplay //
    // method for castling //
    
  def Knight
    methods 1: 
      moveForward 2 + moveLeft 1
      moveForward 2 + moveRight 1

    method 2:
      moveBack 2 + moveLeft 1
      moveBack 2 + moveRight 1

    method 3:
      moveLeft 2 + moveForward 1
      moveLeft 2 + moveBack 1

    method 4:
      moveRight 2 + moveForward 1
      moveRight 2 + moveBack 1

  def Bishop
      moveForward + moveLeft
      moveForward + moveRight
      moveBack + moveLeft
      moveBack + moveRight
      // must take into account how many spaces are available, including pieces in the path //
      // def max = maximum number of spaces Bishop can move //
      // def min = minimum number of spaces Bishop can move //
      // must have TONS of if-statements, given high level of contingency in Bishop's movements //

  def King
      // EndGame Methods //
      // one for King-in-Check --> King-out-of-Check //
      // one or King-in-Check --> endgame method, CHECKMATE //
      // one for Pawn-to-King //
      // normal gameplay method below //
      moveForward 1 space + moveLeft 1 space
      moveForward 1 space + moveRight 1 space
      moveBack 1 space + moveLeft 1 space
      moveBack 1 space + moveRight 1 space

  def Queen
     move

THINGS I EXPECT TO INCLUDE IN MY CODE:
If-Statements.
For-Loops (maybe... not sure how useful they would be)
Recursion (???)
Boolean Values for player errors
touch.py <-- or similar script to determine if player has "released" the piece. 
    self.touch (has the player removed their hand?) == None or not None.
    if self.touch == None
        LED == off
        fiddle == None [patch is not operating or frequency has been found]
    else
        LED == on [would look lovely on a glass chessboard]
        fiddle == not None [patch is analyzing frequencies]

Mic needs to "hear" minimum amplitude.
    def minAmp
        // Bypasses the problem of the noise floor to facilitate gameplay//
    
    def Release    
        // Cannot move again until opponent has moved//
        // enforces rules for touching and releasing pieces//
    
#winning method for victorious player, #wompwomp method for losing player
    could trigger sound effects coming from each speaker after all endgame methods have been executed.
